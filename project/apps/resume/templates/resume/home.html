		<div class="overview">
			<p class="introduction">I write really excellent <strong>Python</strong>, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.  I've spent the past four years living and breathing <strong>django</strong> on the backend, and <strong>vanilla.js</strong>, <strong>jQuery</strong> and <strong>backbone</strong> on the front. I can knock out <strong>pixel-perfect</strong> CSS, even for IE.  I've also been a web developer for 15+ years, so there are a lot of other languages and skills in the toolbox. UI. UX. Devops. Server admin. Automation. CI builds. Robots. Command-line tools.  I know mysql and postgresql and redis. I know memcached and rabbitmq and celery. I check <strong>my life</strong> into git.</p>

			<p class="experience">I've also written and released a number of <strong>open source</strong> projects, like <strong>salad</strong>, <strong>autoscalebot</strong>, zebra, <strong>django-ajax-uploader</strong>, django-longer-username, and more - and grown the communities around them.  I've built entire large codebases from scratch, and waded into years of <strong>technical debt</strong> that made <em>grown men and women cry</em> and come out with working, <strong>tested</strong> code and better abstractions.</p>

		<h2>Experience</h2>


		<div class="work_experience">
			<p class="introduction">I've also been lucky to found, work at, and work with some amazing companies.Most recently, that's:</p>

			<div class="company">
				<div class="name">Building Energy</div>
				<div class="title">Senior Engineer</div>
				<div class="description">Designed a decoupled pub-sub application architecture, and built it in a few weeks. Built the deploy system, a generalized data importer, Yeti, an amazingly helpful and friendly bot, and flint, a dev-facing command-line tool.  Drove culture from no tests to functional coverage and unit tests on all new code.</div>
			</div>

			<div class="company">
				<div class="name">Wieden+Kennedy</div>
				<div class="title">Creative Technical Lead</div>
				<div class="description">Pushed creative digital thinking on the Coke, Laika, and Nike Golf accounts. Worked on a P&amp;G global campaign, helped conceptualize and code the ParaNorman campaign, and watched my work in this year's Super Bowl.</div>
			</div>

			<div class="company">
				<div class="name">GoodCloud</div>
				<div class="title">Co-Founder, CEO, Coder.</div>
				<div class="description">Built a full-featured CRM, donor and volunteer management platform for small nonprofits in four months, with one hand tied behind my back at a day job.  Open-sourced a number of libraries from the codebase.</div>
			</div>


			<p class="more_experience">I've also led teams of programmers at UCSD, founded another two companies, run a sole proprietorship for the better part of a decade, and have a degree in Environmental Engineering from Cornell.  And I wrote the international ethobotany repository, after two summers in Peru interviewing shamans.  It's been an interesting ride.

		<p class="description">I'm looking for interesting problems and smart, smart people to work with.  I want to learn things and teach people things, and most of all - make things.  Good things.  Things that make some human somewhere really happy. It might be that my next place is with you.  Let's talk, and find out!</p>
