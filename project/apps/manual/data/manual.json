I want to be wanted, physically. to feel like I'm sexy. and right now, particularly to feel like my cock is sexy.  at the moment, it is the physical manifestation of me during sex. it's what I want to be sexy, wanted, desired.  whether I want to change that or not (do I?), that's where I am at the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanother thing: wetness.  sex with A showed me that while yes, it's a bit a desire thing, it's also likely an age thing. I need to adjust my judgements to reflect that for women over 30, being not wet can be a lot of things.  it's not a reflection of me. it's not that I didn't turn her on enough (though that may still be true, wetness won't always be a reliable indicator.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na biggie: coming. I've prided myself on not coming quickly. that may be it, but it also may be all the residual guilt I felt every time I came in my teens.  don't forget there were three or four hormone-riddled years where I prayed and flogged myself every time I came for letting god down.  i scrubbed the carpet. hid in the bathroom. those were formative experiences, and they don't go away easily.\r\n\r\nso, I'll have to do a little therapy. turn my orgasms into things that are awesome, beautiful, wanted, and appropriate anytime. seriously. I'd be happy anytime my partner came, it's cool for me to come anytime. period. yes, there's the came-too-soon dude stereotype, but that's never been a problem for me. plus, I get back up quickly, and if I started coming quickly, that'd be huge progress, and could be a hell of a lot of fun for both of us.\r\n\r\nso, how to get there? well, let's make it fun. off once a day. no sock, no degradation. focus on the feeling, and use a mantra of this is beautiful, wanted, and I can come whenever I want. make it feel good, something I look forward to every day. (see? fun!). porn's cool, but focus on you. it's about my pleasure, my body, my enjoyment, and the fact that there's nothing even remotely bad to feel guilty about. it's - every moment of it good, healthy, and fun. I deserve to enjoy it. full-on.\r\n\r\nhow to also get there with a partner? communicate.  make it fun. make it something we can both enjoy and work for. maybe it's a race, and if I come within 5 minutes, we get something we both like. who knows. something specific that we're both up for, with measurable milestones, and more importantly,a fun and shared journey.\r\n\r\nnone of these things get better without consistency. but that doesn't mean that the consistency can't be fun. and it shouldn't be a journey that's done alone.\r\n\r\nfinally, it's important to know that these, the things above, are the real issues. Anal is not. when and where is not. those are flailings for what was wrong,  and while they might be fun, they're not the core of the tension, or the things to fix first.\r\n\r\nI've got to stay open, and communicative - with myself and with a partner. say things like, \"I want to be able to tap into that male power, that aggression, that *fucking*, and right now, I stop myself because I'm afraid of hurting you, and I've had too many women I love raped and hurt and I don't really know how to reconcile that true passion and maleness I have with intimacy. If you're game, I'd like to explore this with you, bit by bit.\"\r\n\r\nthings like \"I want to be able to come quickly, just because it feels good, and feel like I am beautiful, good, a sexy for doing it. I would love to work with you to figure out fun ways to get there.\"\r\n\r\nthings like, \"I want us to have the best sex on earth. what are some things you would like improve?\"\r\n\r\nTHAT is a real start. THAT is real communication.  THAT is what I want. and *that* is what I am now clear and brave enough to do.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n\"i can come\" / \"you are allowed to come\"  (permission)\r\n\r\nvs\r\n\r\n\"i want you to come\" (pressure)\r\n\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n\"i want to come\"   <- fuck yeah.  go for it!\r\n\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nWith Bonnie - insecuritities:\r\nNot biggest cock\r\nNot longest\r\nNot best feeling\r\nNot best fucking\r\nNot best sex\r\nJust solid\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nInsight: relate to my cock as a part of my body, not as me.\r\n\"I want my cock to come\"\r\n\"My cock feels so good like that\"\r\n\"I want my cock to feel that\"\r\n\"My cock is coming!\"",

Nike Marathon project died, actually had some free time to work on trigger.io\n\nRealization this evening - the \"a future decision with a bad possibility -> depression\" is a habit, and I can change it.  Planning for potential bad stuff is good. Dwelling on it doesn't help. If it comes, then be sad then.  In the meantime, allow space for time spent thinking about the positive, the good possibilities.\n\nI tried it, and it really helped.\n\nWent to an AMAZING write around reading, fantastically powerful, and we changed people's lives. Period.\n\nGrabbed food with Bonnie afterwards, and had great, easy conversation about all kinds of things.  She's heading to Missoula next week, trying to figure things out sooner.  Went looking for Charlie because we have an incredible connection, but it didn't work on the kids level. Now that's an option. She's confused, and trying to take time to let things settle and come to a good decision.\n\nAlso wants time for herself, to work through things, and go through the growth I've had of late, for herself. Once she gets back from Missoula, she's getting an apartment, and getting some Bon time, regardless of whether there's an us or not.  Told her I totally get it, support it, support her no matter what.\n\nWalked away feeling good about things, focused on the potential good, aware that what will be, will be, and now, trying to just *be* in the present moment.\n\nHappiness scale: complicated.  Earlier, just after getting home from work, it was a 2.  Now it's an 8.\n\nGood job me for being present and making these habits continue!",

            "notes": "Morning - still some down feelings with the bittersweet of where things are with Bon right now.  Some bittersweet with the BE offer too.\nNot enough sleep at all.  Really plan to get to sleep at 11:30 today.\n\nLots of crying and feeling sad this morning - Bon doc, pasting them below.\n\nOuch.  It all unravels and hits me at once.  I feel like some sort of transaction, some \"good enough\" plan. There's never been one moment, not one in this entire thing when she's looked at me and had excitement or joy and said, \"I can't wait to start a life with you\" or \"I want you to be the father of my kids\" or \"we're gonna be great parents.\"  I feel like I'm plan b.  And I want to be wanted.  I want someone to be enthused and excited about starting a life with me.  To feel as lucky as I do.  And I've got none of that.\nIntellectually, I understand, because it's complicated, but also I feel like there should have been at least one moment, just one, where she was excited, and looked at me with joy and optimism - and I can't find one.  Emotionally, this hurts a lot, and I wonder if it's what she really wants, if it's a good idea, if she actually has any of those feelings. This feeling sucks.\n\n(Some of it comes from watching her publicly mourn on facebook, and that's like a knife to the heart, and I'm not allowed to do anything about it or say anything at all. Fuck, that hurts.)\n\nNot sure what to do about it. I'd like to talk to her, to actually be able to communicate about this stuff, but we're in this fucking \"no communication\" period of time, which from my current perspective, seems like a totally fucked up way to start building a relationship where we want to have good communication.  WTF.\n\nAnd I have a terrible headache from not enough sleep and too much crying. That's not helping.\nNot sure what to do about it at this point, I guess go to work, and trust that things will eventually work out.\n\nIt's also hard with the job stuff because I want her input - it's a decision that has big implications on our life, and I can't.  And with the debt stuff, it just seems unfair and\n\nAll the questions and the marry-into-debt-stuff just hit me and man, that hurts.  It's like I'm just a series of checkboxes, and not quite good enough for what she wants but the best option she's got, so she'll take it.\nWhere's the person who wants me?  Who thinks I'm great, and who wants to start a life with me? Does she exist?\nI've spent all this time trying to show her that I'm up for it, that I'm ready for the challenge and the joy, and in return, all I've gotten is a \"you'll probably do. if you fix this and this and this about yourself and life to my standards.\" This fucking sucks.\n\nI want wanted.  I hope somewhere, it's there.\n\n---\n\nEmotional:  Watching her publicly mourn in front of her friends and not being able to do anything is torture, shitty, and unfair.  It's made more sharply painful by the thought that I don't think if she'd decided the other way, she'd be doing this at all.  She would have just moved forward.  I don't think (other than what's inferred by her actions) I have a real view or feel for her emotions toward me. I need to.\n\nMaybe we need to take some space, some real space, and then start from somewhere mutual.  For her to totally get over Charlie, and be able to come in from a place where she can actually emotionally engage with me.  This foundation needs to be build on trust, and respect, and love and communication.  If the love and want and I-think-you're-amazing isn't there, it won't work. It needs to be.\n\nSo maybe that's it. We take space, and move forward with our lives, and see what's there when the dust settles.  I know that where I am right now isn't a place to start. \n\nHeading to work:\n\"Moving forward. If have to adopt a kid and be a single father, i will.\"\n\n\nLunch:\nNever. Not once. Not for one moment was there the excitement of \"I want to start a life with you\" or \"I think you're going to be a great dad\". And that fucking sucks.  And if that's not true, if those emotions aren't really there, then maybe she should go with Charlie.  I want to start a life with someone who's excited to be with me, excited for the things we can do and share together - not just someone for whom I check all the necessary boxes. \n\nIf she's not there, I'm not sure any of this is a good idea.  If she is there, she's got to figure out a way to communicate that in a way I can feel.\n---\nFeel like I want to act.  Drive out there, and talk. What I should do is get a full night's sleep, wait a day or two, and see if that's still how I feel.\n\n\nCool sharp stuff idea, gonna build it tomorrow.\n\nHung with Robyn, got it out.  It's good to talk to someone else, and get some perspective.",

Understand, find a way to communicate that to Bonnie (and why) without it being accusatory or angry.  Communicate openly and honestly about my emotions, and let us both do the same.\n2. Simply, I have strong emotions. They will wash over me like the ocean.  My vows, presence, perspective, are the piers of me. All of us in this together.\n\n\nMade a counteroffer w/ buildingenergy.\n\nThey called references.\n\nHad a call. Told them 110 would be an easy decision, 105, is possible, but tougher.  They want me out of goodcloud, to make sure I won't run off on it.\n\nTonight, angry. Realizing that I've never gotten anything besides half-hearted answers from Bonnie. No real \"yes, I want you.  You, Steven Zmoth Skoczen.  You're going to be a great dad. You're the one I want to start a family with.\"\n\nI deserve that.  And if they don't come, fuck it.  I'll find someone who does love me.\n\n\nOk.  Got a good ride in.  Talked to Jeff.\n\nFrom the ride:\n\"Nobody's perfect. Not even Bonnie.\"  The way she handled this, particularly with the emotional distance and the facebook shit was shitty and not particularly sensitive.  I'm hurt, and I should be.  That's ok. \n\nI was angry. Still might be. That's also ok.  What I've got to figure out is how to communicate that effectively, or work through it until I can communicate it. The examples I have for dealing with anger (mom, dad) aren't particularly good.  I'll have to find a good way to deal with it.  The aggressive bike ride, having a beer, and unwinding a bit helped.  Talking to Jeff helped.\n\nSomehow, we'll have to find a way to actually have conflicts. That's important.\n\nMoving forward with this job thing, seeing if it makes sense in two lenses: a) with Bonnie, b) as a single dad, two years from now, adopting a kid. \n\nWas just really tired of this all dragging on earlier tonight. Still am, a bit. I think it's worth it, but I'm just worn out.\n\nNeed to recharge this weekend, take space, think through the job and what I want to do next.\n\nBIG NOTE:\nTooth pain (dental work) is very much a depression trigger. Know and plan for that when dental appointments happen. Schedule in some good cuddling and love those days.\n\n\n.. calling it a night.  Will clean up the house and make a list in the morning.
