This is codebase for stevenskoczen.com, including the Steven Manual.  This is the project where I've taken those code skills I use to great effect professionally and artistically, and turned them on myself, and my life.  Nothing here is generalized, or for some broader purpose.  This is my project to be selfish, to help me wring every bit out of the seconds of my life.

You might find it useful, but I'd bet probably not.  See, unlike most of my other projects, the Steven Manual has only one code rule: this code is never going to be reused, repurposed, or serve some greater general good.  Hacks are totally fine here.  Duct-tape is great.  Hideous memory usage, design, and abuse of programming paradigms are all done and applauded.  There is only one user, and they're quite understanding - because they're me.
